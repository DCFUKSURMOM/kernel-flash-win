# kernel-flash
Modified version of sshflash-win that only flashes the kernel, this allows users to flash different kernels without redoing their rootfs.

Just copy this file to an existing sshflash-win install

I do not intend to maintain this, flashing is very buggy on Windows and its a pain in the ass to get working.
Please consider flashing from Linux using the linux version of this script.
A premade Linux image with the required tools will hopefully be uploaded eventually, I have a lot of projects going on.
